performance comparison of multi-label learning algorithms on clinical data for chronic diseases	Just calls it mimic-ii dataset. Talks about: “Our goal is to provide a performance comparison of state-of-the-art multi-label learning algorithms for the analysis of multivariate sequential clinical data from medical records of patients affected by chronic diseases. As a matter of fact, the multi-label learning approach appears to be a good candidate for modeling overlapped medical conditions, specific to chronically ill patients”. I don’t have access to full text.
